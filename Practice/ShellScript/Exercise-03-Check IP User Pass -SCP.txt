#Exercise 3:
#Write a program that has the IP of a server and its User/Pass in front of the Script
#name and if it is pingable, sends its /etc/passwd file to /home/user path of that server,
#otherwise a message displayed that the server is not accessible.


read -p "Please insert ip address server: " ip
read -p "Please insert User Server: " user
read -p "Please insert Password Server: " password

ping -c 1 $ip &> /dev/null

if [ $? = 0  ]
then
  echo "success"
  sshpass -p "$password" scp -r /etc/passwd $user@$ip:/home/hpo
else
  echo "error"
